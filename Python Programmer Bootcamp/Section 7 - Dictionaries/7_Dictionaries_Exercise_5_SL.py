# 1. Access and print the first fiction book's title
#     - Extract the title of the first book in the fiction category. 
#     - Print it in the format: "First Fiction book title: <title>"
#
# 2. Access and print the author of the second science book.
#     - Extract the author of the second book in the Science category.
#     - Print it in the format: "Second Science book author: <author>"
#
# 3. Display each book in the history category
#     - Loop over each book in the History category.
#     - For each book, print a sentence describing it, 
#     in the format: "In the History category, we have <title> by <author>"
